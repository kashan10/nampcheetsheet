Identify all active hosts in a network 
nmap -sP <target_IP>/Subnet 
Do a Stelth Scan, Invading firewall, IDS/IPS 
nmap -sS -p 80, 443 <target_IP>/Subnet 
Identify the OS of the machine hosting a DB To check target with open DB port (3306 or 1433): 
nmap -sV IP/subnet
or
nmap -A IP/subnetornmap -p3306,1433 IP/subnet and check relative info about OS. 
Locate IP address of the machine with RDP open port 
nmap -Pn -p -sV 3389 <target_IP>
Scan subnet or target filtering for LDAP port (389): 
nmap -p389 -sV -iL <target_list> -> if we've more targets IP 
or 
nmap -p389 -sV <target_IP>
or 
nmap -p 389 --script ldap-rootdse <target_IP>
If LDAP port is filtered or closed, we should try to scan host using following parameters:
nmap -Pn -A <target_IP> In alternative we can find following ports opened: 88 (Kerberos), 636 (LDAPS), 3268 (LDAP Global).
FQDN = Hostname + Domain


Identify the number of hosts that are alive to checks hosts up: nmap -sn IP/Subnet 
Identify potential vulnerabilities of services 
nmap -Pn --script vuln <target_IP> 


To find DOS (SYN and ACK) : 
statistic -> IPv4 statistics -> source and destination address 
filter using:tcp.flags.syn == 1
or 
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0 
or 
filter to highest number of request

Analyze the pcap file and determine the number of machines that were involved in DDOS attack 
statistic -> IPv4 statistic -> source and destination address 
Or 
View Flood attack on victim via Wireshark | use filter tcp.port=21
Or 
Find the dos attacker ip using Wireshark Statistic -> conversion 
identified ip , which has flooding server with SYN request. 
Or
get the statistics of ipv4 -> we can see that Packets B -> A are null, because the're not reply pack.

To find passwords : http.request.method == POST
To find DOS -> Look for Red and Black packets with around 1-2 simple packets in between and then pick any packet and check the Source and Destination IP with port if need.
SYN DDOS Attack using Hping 
hping3 -S 1.1.1.6 -a 1.1.1.3 -p 22 --flood
1.1.1.6 is target IP 1.1.1.3 is the spoof IP 22 is port number.
POD - Ping of Death Attack
hping3 -d 65538 -S -p 21 --flood 1.1.1.6 
-d is data size -S is syn packets -p is port (you can flood any app with open ports. 
UDP Flood attack 
hping3 -2 -p 139 --flood 1.1.1.6 -2 is for UDP 
-p is port
